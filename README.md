Profile
=======

I build tools designed to enable the design of data-rich systems in
novel situations. My focus, and the focus that I encourage in others, is
to use algorithms that can be clearly understood and interpreted in the
organisations that deploy them.

    for Modelling Dynamic Spatiotemporal Systems’**</span>. Awarded June

Selected Projects and Outcomes
==============================

**Realtime Monitoring of Web-based Systems** (New York 2011 onwards) My
work at bitly and The New York Times involves finding and exposing value
in the data assets collected through the behaviour of large online media
audiences. This work is highly varied, involving one-off analysis
projects, product prototyping, infrastructure development, and tool
building. My work has focused mainly on online stream processing
applications, the dominant online data structure.

-   **Streamtools: https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools** NYT R&D.
    2014-2015. Streamtools is an open source, graphical toolkit for
    dealing with live streams of data. Its aim was to allow analysts and
    designers build algorithms that work directly on a stream of data,
    rather than performing offline processing at a later date.

-   **Bitly Science: http://bitlyscience.github.com** Bitly Science
    Team. 2011-2012. This website showcases a number of blog posts and
    magazine articles created using analysis from the bitly science
    team. My role has been to do the analysis for a number of posts, as
    well as work with teams in the mainstream media, most notably The
    Guardian and Scientific American.

**Prototyping Future Media** (New York 2013-) A lot of my work at the New York Times involves contributing to the speculative prototyping work the lab performs. Specifically I have contributed to

-  **editor: http://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html** NYT R\&D. 2014-2015. A prototype text editor that uses a recurrent neural network to perform semi-automated tagging of sub-sentence blocks of text.
-  **lazarus: http://nytlabs.com/projects/lazarus.html** NYT R\&D. 2013-2014. A system that uses some basic machine vision techniques to associate a photo from the physical archive with its digital counterpart in the NYT's digital archive.
- **colony: https://github.com/nytlabs/colony** NYT R\&D. 2014. A microservice messaging framework for NSQ (http://nsq.io/), used to explore what kind of systems are afforded by distributed computation and deployment.

**Spatiotemporal Modelling** (Sheffield, Edinburgh, New York
2003-2011) - This project began with my PhD Thesis, which was focused on
learning linear dynamic models from spatiotemporal data. The main focus
of this work is learning models which are interpretable in terms of the
underlying system. My work has been followed up on in two main projects:
neural field modelling and an analysis of the Afghanistan Wikileaks data
set.

**Modelling Behaviour** (Edinburgh and New York 2008 - 2014) - This
work, the Edinburgh portion of which resulted in a successful startup
called Actual Analytics, seeks to automate routine animal behavioural
analysis from collected video data. I continued the theoretical aspects
of this work at Columbia University, and scaled up to large online
audiences at The New York Times.

Community Engagement

A large part of my work involves engaging with and sometimes building
the communities around the disciplines I work within.

-   <span>**NYT R&D Data Meeting**</span> 2013-. I run a weekly,
    internal cross-departmental meeting at the NYT designed to explore
    the use of data, in all its forms, inside the NYT.

-   <span>**Data Gotham**</span> 2012-2013. I was a co-organizer of Data
    Gotham - a two day event celebrating Data Science in New York.
